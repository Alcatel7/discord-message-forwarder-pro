Forward msgs easily, use a middle discord server to prevent that the accounts are banned from the target server. 
Need to use very aged account if the server that the msgs get forwarded from is very active
Steps ideally:
1. Create a blank server
2. Forward msgs to the blank server from the server you want to forward messages FROM using middleman js
3. Forward the msgs from the blank server to the server you want them to forward them TO using multitoken js
